        <h3>Article Time</h3>
        <p>
          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to understand why
          there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
          created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made
          the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
          course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
          special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
          swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
          instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
          the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
          and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
          diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. “SPECTACULAR
          REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
          double box around it. On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio
          astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang,
          and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
          right. Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
          cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
          led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
          Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called
          gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched
          violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a
          trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun
          evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that
          Dr. Guth was correct. Unlock more free articles. Create an account or
          log in Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
          though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be
          proved. If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
          science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the
          universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms
          of time and space and energy to science and speculation. Confirming
          inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
          light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is
          only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
          architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own
          universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling
          into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over. ‘As Big
          as It Gets’ In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the
          forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
          Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
          waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
          should ruffle space-time. Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins
          University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
          said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.” He continued, “This is a
          signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
          gravitational waves.” The ripples manifested themselves as faint
          spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space
          and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old
          and as hot as the surface of the sun. Dr. Kovac and his collaborators,
          working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
          Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a
          scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and
          in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

            <span class="diagram-title">THE UNIVERSE</span> is just under 14
            billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can
            observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across.
            But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even
            temperature.
          </p>
          <p class="cap2">
            <span class="diagram-title">NOT ENOUGH TIME </span> The universe is
            not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one
            side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough
            time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even
            temperature.
          </p>
          <p class="cap3">
            <span class="diagram-title">DISTANT COFFEE</span> At a smaller
            scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction.
            You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate
            its temperature and how much it has cooled.
          </p>
          <p class="cap4">
            <span class="diagram-title">COFFEE EVERYWHERE </span> Now turn
            around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar
            coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But
            if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look
            for another explanation.
          </p>
          <p class="cap5">
            <span class="diagram-title">STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME </span> There has
            not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before
            they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a
            single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their
            even temperature.
          </p>
          <p class="cap6">
            <span class="diagram-title">INFLATION</span> solves this problem.
            The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after
            the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light.
            Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew
            into the large-scale structures of the universe.
          </p>
          <p class="cap7">
            <span class="diagram-title">FLUCTUATION</span> Astronomers have now
            detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of
            polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy
            left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves
            predicted by Einstein.
          </p>
          <p class="cap8">
            <span class="diagram-title">EXPANSION</span> Returning to our
            coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light
            and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something
            like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth
            and foam of the original pot.
