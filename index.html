        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist
        named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
        stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
        world of known physics. He was trying to understand why there was no
        trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in the Big
        Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
        begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
        could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
        repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of
        light for a prodigiously violent instant. If true, the rapid engorgement
        would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
        pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would
        iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not
        missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and
        drew a double box around it. On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in.
        Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big
        Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
        right. Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
        cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led
        by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
        detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational
        waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when
        it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
        old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
        Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct. Unlock more
        free articles. Create an account or log in Inflation has been the
        workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
        wondered whether it could ever be proved. If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s
        work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
        discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang
        itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to
        science and speculation. Confirming inflation would mean that the
        universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
        hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a
        larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
        Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
        other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water
        boiling over. ‘As Big as It Gets’ In our own universe, it would serve as
        a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach
        of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity
        itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
        gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general
        relativity, should ruffle space-time. Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins
        University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said,
        “This is huge, as big as it gets.” He continued, “This is a signal from
        the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational
        waves.” The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
        bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture
        of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface
        of the sun. Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment
        known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
        Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the
        Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted
        to The Astrophysical Journal.
