# Page Positioning Project

## New York Times Article

A recreation of a NYT page to study the positioning of elements and implementing flexbox and css-grid. Challenges along the way included many small instances of positioning acting in unexpected ways! Refering to documentation and refactoring html to include wrapping divs was the primary modus operandi for eliminating visual bugs.

Key spots on the page with their positioning techniques include flexbox in the suggested articles footer, grid in the multi-image figure part way through the article, and media queries mixed with flexbox to allow the article images to resize as needed.
